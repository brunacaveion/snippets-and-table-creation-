# snippets-and-table-creation-
  A snippet is a macro text that you can use to make your code easy to read and avoid CTRL+C CTRL+V of other codes.
 
 Here you can find how to use snippets to make your data manipulation easier, and use this results to create a table.
 
  Using the filter() function from tidyverse package, you can creat a snippet to filter a smaller table from your table, filtering by what you need. We also create a mean snippet with the mean() function, to avoid repeat this function other times.
  
  After that, we create a table with 2 columns, combining the snippets and using the functions rbind() and cbind(). 
  
With typeof() function we can see the type of your data.

We can change a table to dataframe using as.data.frame() function.
